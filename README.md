In this Project, I've built an AI Summarizing WebApp using GPT-3 API. This WebApp is extremely useful for converting Long Paragraphs and Essays into Smaller Pieces of Readable Text. Using this tool, one can even Generate Summaries of Entire Websites. So, just use it and have fun!

Use the `README.md` to get started.
